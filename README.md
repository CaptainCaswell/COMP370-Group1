# COMP 370 - Group 1 - Mini-Project 1

## Testing procedure

For basic testing, run `basic test.bat`. This will start up a server, client, and monitor.

For more advanced testing, run `test.bat`. This will start up 2 clients, 1 monitor, and 3 servers. Failover can be simulated by closeing the primary server.

For UI testing, run `UI.bat`. This will only start a monitor, but more can be started from the interface.
